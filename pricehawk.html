            <h3 class="p-step-first">Problem</h3>
            <p>Shoppers are having to use multiple sites and/or apps to search and compare prices from various stores for a product they need. Too much time is going into finding the information they need, and with unit prices not being shown consistently, shoppers are having to do the breakdown themselves. As a result, shoppers are not conducting price comparisons, and in the end, not always finding the best deals.</p>

            <p>Introducing PriceHawk, a grocery shopping companion app that helps you search and compare all products at once. No more having to search per store or having to calculate the unit price. Shoppers are able to open the app and conduct a quick search for what they need.</p>

                <h3 class="p-step-first">User Survey</h3>
                <p>Through this research, I wanted to get an insight on shopper patterns and gauge how many people actually compare prices. An interesting discovery was that not as many people actually use the various applications that are currently available. The results of this survey provided a good direction in terms of how to further study the various types of shoppers and discover how to change app usage patterns. Three main focuses were how often they compare prices, what resource(s) they currently use, and pain points. A common pain point was the time consuming effort of looking up products to compare prices. Another was not always being able to see the unit price. Of the participants, only 60% compared prices, and from that group, 32% look at sales and deals on physical weekly ads, 32% look up on individual store’s websites, and 16% use an app that displays weekly ads. Only 1 shopper uses an app that compares various stores, and the rest use various other methods.

                <h3 class="p-step-first p-step">Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>With the knowledge of popular applications and the biggest pain points in mind, I focused my analysis on Instacart, Basket and Flipp. I wanted to closely look at where each excels and falls short. Where one excels, the others fall short, like comparing prices on all types of items and all stores at once.

            <p>Once the sketches were refined and the initial layouts set, wireframes were finalized in Figma. The wireframes helped to visualize and test the flow of the potential application. Each screen so far included the necessary information users need to see. Placement of icons, functions, features were explored in different ways to discover the best option.

            The color palette consists of a primary and secondary colors, an accent color, and neutrals. The primary color is a bright forest green to convey a fresh, trustworthy brand.<br><br>
            The typefaces were chosen due to their geometric shapes that provide versatility for larger body of text and smaller font sizes, and mainly providing great legibility for the numbers at any scale.

                <p>With the initial layouts revised and set, several different types of user testing were conducted. The first round of hi-fi usability testing consisted of having the users carry out four tasks: </p>

                <div>
                    <h5 class="label">Tasks</h5>
                    <ol>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Users were able to successfully complete most of the tasks smoothly without too many delays or issues. Key details, like the unit prices, stood out and helped the users quickly obtain the information they needed. Navigation issues in terms of quick access to sections arose, and placements of icons and fields were noted to reconsider. Something surprising that arose during the testing was that Androids users were not yet familiar/accustomed to in-app barcode scanning.

                <p>PriceHawk was born out of a desire to help a busy shopper by making the process of searching and comparing prices easier to complete and manage. Through various research, extensive user testing and feedback, PriceHawk has become a shopper companion that can help enhance the overall experience.<br><br>
                Going into this project, I was worried about entering a market with such large and popular competitors. But through analysis and research, I was able to find a niche to set it apart from the rest. Trying to create a flow that speeds up the search process, yet also is detailed and intuitive was challenging. But having the key MVPs and main goals in mind helped to keep myself aligned on what I need to focus on in order to make this successful.<br><br>
                Couple things that surprised me were learning that scanning a barcode was still not a familiar concept to some android users, and that AR(augmented reality) is still a very new and foreign concept to many.  If I had more time and resources, I would do more detailed testing of each flow to test out different approaches. I would also create more design concepts for the main screen, and test to ensure the final product satisfies the needs of the average shopper.
